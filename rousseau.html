					<p>Jean Jacques Rousseau(28 June 1712 â€“ 2 July 1778) was a Swiss philosopher and writer. His philosophy has had a large influence on the course of the Enlightenment, the French Revolution, and even modern political thought.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="section1">
					<h2>Youth</h2>
					<p>Rousseau was born in the 28th of June 1712 in Geneva, a Calvinist city-state of the Swiss Confederacy. His mother passed away just nine days after his birth, and he and his brother were brought up by their father and aunt. His father instilled in him a life-long love of reading from an early age, and the young Rousseau came to love escapist stories especially. He would later recount that these stories "gave me bizarre and romantic notions of human life, which experience and reflection have never been able to cure myself of".</p>
					<p>At the age of 13, Rousseau did an apprenticeship with a notary and then with an engraver. At 15, he ran away from Geneva and fled to Savoy after returning to the city and being refused entry as he was out past curfew. In Savoy, Rousseau converted to Catholicism, resulting in his disownment and loss of Genevan citizenship. Unable to return home, the young Rousseau wandered Italy and France doing odd jobs as a secretary or tutor. He would later move to Paris.</p>

					<h2>Did you know?</h2>
					<p>Rousseau devised an entirely new system of musical notation based on a single line. As you might know from ever attending music class, it was rejected.</p>

					<h2>Philosophy</h2>
					<p>Rousseau believed that man is inherently good and that society makes him wicked and corrupt. This was at odds with many of his contemporaries and predecessor, who contended that man was 'fallen' and needed to be taught virtue by civilised society. Rousseau, however, asserted that "uncorrupted morals" prevail in the "state of nature". He associated the stage of human development of so-called "savages" was the optimal stage, between brutish animals on one extreme and decadent civilisation on the other.</p>
					<p>Rousseau's view was essentially that morality was not taught by society, but rather innate. He believed society had a negative influence on men in that it corrupted man's <i lang="fr">amour de soi</i> (self-love) into <i lang="fr">amour-propre</i> (pride). The former, he argued, was natural. The latter, however, was artificial and created unwarranted fear of inferiority, thus allowing men to take pleasure in the weakness of others(as they could be proud of their strength by comparison).</p>
					<section class="quote">
						<p><em>The first man who, having fenced in a piece of land, said 'This is mine', and found people na&iuml;ve enough to believe him, that man was the true founder of civil society.</em></p>
						<p>Jean Jacques Rousseau</p>
					</section>
					<p>Rousseau also contends that art and science have not been good for mankind, because they come not from a real human need but rather vanity. He also believed that the idleness created by the advancement of society has corrupted man, as idleness is an unnatural state of being. Therefore, he concludes that progress is harmful to the well-being of mankind, in sharp contrast to the views of other Enlightenment figures. Whereas Kant tells us to "Dare to know!", Rousseau declares that knowledge can often be harmful for society, unless tempered by a greater cultivation and understand of morality.</p>

					<h2>Death and Legacy</h2>
					<p>Rousseau died on the 2nd of July 1778, following an apoplectic stroke. Although rumours had been spread that he had committed suicide or that he had gone insane before he died, those who knew him in his final days said he was in a peaceful state of mind. On the 4th of July, he was buried in <i lang="fr">&Icirc;le des Peupliers</i>, but following the French Revolution his remains were moved to the <i lang="fr">Panth&eacute;on</i> along with Voltaire's.</p>
					<p>Many of Rousseau's ideas would have a great impact on French Revolution which would occur less than twenty years after his passing. Robespierre believed that the superfluities and corruption of society had to be done away with, and that the deficiencies in men were to be corrected by upholding the "common good". Both these ideas find their origin in Rousseau's <i>General Will</i>.
