					<p><span lang="fr">Fran&ccedil;ois-Marie Arouet</span> (21 November 1694 – 30 May 1778), better known by his <i lang="fr">nom de plume</i> Voltaire, was a French satirist and philosopher known for fierce criticism of the established Catholic Church in France, as well as his fervent support for free speech and separation of church and state. His renowned wit and intelligence made him one of the most famous French writers of the <b>Age of Enlightenment</b>.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="section1">
					<h2>Early Life</h2>
					<p>Born in Paris on the 21st of November 1694 as the son of a treasurer and minor nobility, Voltaire was educated by in the prestigious Jesuit school of <i lang="fr">Coll&eacute;ge Louis-le-Grand</i>, where he learned Latin, theology and rhetoric. He would later go on to learn Italian, Spanish, and English, among others.</p>
					<p>Upon leaving school he sought out a career as a writer. Although his father sent him to study law, he continued to write, his prose and witticisms earning him great popularity among the French aristocracy. However, one satirical verse, in which he accused the <i lang="fr">Régent</i> of incest, led to his imprisonment in the Bastille. It was shortly thereafter that he adopted his now infamous <i lang="fr">nom de plume</i>. And so the legendary writer Voltaire was born.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="section2">
					<h2>Writings</h2>
					<p>Voltaire's writings are, almost without exception, characterised by their caustic, sarcastic and polemical nature. In his satirical novella <i lang="fr">Candide, ou l'Optimisme</i> (Candide: or, The Optimist), he attacks what he considers the na&iuml;vet&eacute; of fellow Enlightenment thinker Gottfried Leibniz's philosophy of optimism through the character Pangloss' frequently repeated mantra that the current situation is the "best of all possible worlds".</p>
					<p>Many of his novellas, such as <i lang="fr">L'Homme aux quarante ecus</i> (The Man of Forty Pieces of Silver) address the social and political climate of his time; <i lang="fr">Zadig ou la Destin&eacute;e</i> (The Book of Fate) while apparently set in ancient Babylon, also refers to the social and political problems of his day, behind thinly veiled metaphors. Some of Voltaire's works were written to mock the Bible. In these works, Voltaire's ironic and caustic style is apparent, often using sarcasm and satire to deride the prevailing dogmas of his day. <i lang="fr">Candide</i> in particular is among the best examples of this. Voltaire was also a pioneer in the genre of science fiction, with his <i lang="fr">Micromégas</i> and the vignette <i>Plato's Dream</i> being among the earliest modern examples of the genre.</p>
					<p>In his <i lang="fr">Trait&eacute; sur la tol&eacute;rance</i> (Treatise on Tolerance), Voltaire attacked the Catholic Church and French society's intolerance towards other religions, contrasting it with more tolerant faiths and societies in the present and past(for example the Chinese and the ancient Romans). This would be one of the first of many works Voltaire wrote against <i lang="fr">l'inf&acirc;me</i>, a French term for the Catholic Church. Interestingly, while a supporter of freedom of speech and religion, Voltaire was no democrat. He strongly criticised democracy, thinking it a form of mob rule. He famously wrote: "Almost nothing great has ever been done in the world except by the genius and firmness of a single man combating the prejudices of the multitude."

					<h2>Did you know?</h2>
					<p>It is said, perhaps apocryphally, that on his deathbed, when asked to return to the Catholic faith and renounce Satan, he responded, “This is no time to be making new enemies."</p>

					<h2>Later Years</h2>
					<p>Voltaire spent much of his later life away from his beloved Paris. When he tried to return in 1754, King <span lang="fr">Louis</span> XV banned him from Paris, so he instead moved to Geneva. The local laws against theatrical performances won his ire, however, and he moved again to Ferney, where he would stay for most of the rest of his life.</p> 
					<p>In February 1778, Voltaire returned to Paris, after spending a quarter century away from it, to see the opening of his latest play <i>Irene</i>. Although he fell ill on the journey, he recovered enough to see a performance of <i>Irene</i> in March, and he was cheered by the audience. He became ill again soon thereafter, however, and pased away. There are many accounts of his final hours and what he supposedly said. Many of his detractors declared that he reverted to the Catholic faith and repented. His adherents asserted that he stayed firm until the very end and refused Last Rites. Regardless, he was refused a Christian burial, although he ended up being secretly buried at an Abbey where his lover's brother was abbot.</p>
					<p>After the French Revolution, Voltaire was regarded as a hero and a forebear by the revolutionaries, who moved his remains to the <i lang="fr">Panth&eacute;on</i> in Paris. The procession was attended by approximately one million people.</p>
