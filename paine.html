					<p>Thomas Paine (9 February 1737 - 8 June 1808) was an American philosopher and revolutionary. His pamphlet <i>Common Sense</i> helped support for independence of the Thirteen Colonies, and is still to this day the best-selling book in America.<p>
				</section>
				<section id="section1">
					<h2>Early Life</h2>
					<p>Thomas Paine was born on the 8th of February 1737 in Norfolk, England. He attended Thetford Grammar School and entered into an apprenticeship under his father aged 13. At 19 he enlisted as a privateer, but returned to Britain in 1759 to work as a staymaker. He moved a few times and entered into a few different careers, before finally emigrating to the American colonies under the recommendation of Benjamin Franklin in 1774.

					<h2>Writings</h2>
					<p>On the 10th of January 1776, Thomas Paine changed American history forever with the publishing of <i>Common Sense</i>. Within three months, over 100,000 copies were printed, at a time when the Thirteen Colonies had just two million residents(many of whom weren't even literate). With its wide reach, plain simple language, and powerful arguments, the pamphlet massively increased support for American Independence at a time when many were still hoping for reconciliation with Britain. Before its publishing, many Americans merely resented the king's ministers and not the monarchy itself. But in the pamphlet Paine fiercely attacked King George III and the concept of monarchy itself, and encouraged the American people to separate themselves from the past and fight for democracy. Read by all the American Founding Fathers, it is considered one of the most important pamphlets of all time.</p>
					<p>After the war, Paine would move to France, then to England, and then finally back to France again once the French Revolution had begun. The actions of the revolutionaries in France earned wide condemnation from the surrounding nations, including Edmund Burke. It was in response to Burke that Paine produced <i>The Rights of Man</i>, a love-letter to and ardent defense of the French Revolution against its detractors. In it, Paine argued that violent revolution is permissible when a government does not protect and guarantee the rights of its people. He argues that human rights originate in nature, and as such cannot be granted nor revoked by the government, and that it is the government's duty to safeguard them. He argues that the French monarchy had refused the people their rights, and that therefore the overthrowal of it was just and necessary.</p>
					<p>In France, Paine was at first elected to the National Convention, before later being imprisoned and nearly executed for being a British citizen(a claim Robespierre denied) once Robespierre took power. In prison, Paine would right his second most famous, and most controversial, pamphlet, <i>The Age of Reason</i>. In it, he declared that all churches and religions were flawed institutions of man. He advocated for deism, the philosophical position that God could only be known by reason and not by revelation. He encouraged people to reject miracles and the supernatural, and he controversially asserted that the Bible was not divinely inspired. This pamphlet, while achieving relative popularity, earned him hatred and ostracisation for his condemnation of Christianity and what people saw as blasphemous claims about the Bible.</p>

				<h2>Did you know?</h2>
				<p>During his imprisonment in France, Paine grew to despise George Washington, believing he had done nothing to secure his release him imprisonment in France. He published a number of scathing attacks on Washington's character and martial ability, and the two never reconciled.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="section3">
					<h2>Later Years</h2>
					<p>In 1802, Paine returned to the United States. Arriving during the midst of the Second Great Awakening, the religious devout despised him for his criticism of Christianity and the Federalists attacking him for his ideas of government in <i>Common Sense</i>, and for his support for the French Revolution. He lived out his remaining years in relative obscurity before dying on the 8th of June, 1809. Only six mourners attended his funeral. Such was the extent of his ostracisation. History, however, has been kinder to him than his contemporaries were, and he is now loved and revered as a Founding Father of the United States.</p>
