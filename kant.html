					<p>Immanuel Kant (22 April 1724 â€“ 12 February 1804) was a Prussian philosopher in the Age of Enlightenment. He is perhaps best known for his philosophy on morality, where he asserts that all morality comes from reason.</p>
				</section>

					<h2>Early Life</h2>
					<p>Immanuel Kant was born on the 22nd of April 1724 to a devout Lutheran family. His parents stressed piety and humility, and as such his education focused on Latin and religious instruction over mathetmatics and science. Because of this, later in life he would struggle to reconcile his Christian faith with his belief in science, but he always retained a belief in God regardless. He attended the College Fridericianum until he graduated at age 16, and enrolled at the University of <span lang="de">K&ouml;nigsberg</span>, where he would remain for the rest of his career.

					<h2>Philosophy</h2>
					<section id="didyouknow">
						<h2>Did you know?</h2>
						<p>In his essay 'What Is Enlightenment?' (1784), Kant summed up the era's motto with the following phrase <i lang="la">Sapere aude</i> - 'Dare to know!'</p>
					</section>
					<p>Kant asserted that while it is impossible to prove the existence of God, it is justifiable to believe in God as a basis for morality and ground for reason. He explained, "If one cannot prove that a thing is, he may try to prove that it is not. If he fails to do either (as often occurs), he may still ask whether it is in his interest to accept one or the other of the alternatives hypothetically, from the theoretical or the practical point of view." He applies this reasoning to the concept of perpetutal peace. We cannot know if perpetual peace is truly possible, Kant explained, but we can(and indeed must, in his opinion) "act on the supposition of it being real".</p>
					<p>In his work the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>, Kant theorises that our understanding of the world comes not only from experience, but from experience and <i lang="la">a priori</i> concepts, thereby creating a "third path" so to speak in epistemology between empiricism(knowledge comes from experience) and rationalism(knowledge comes from reason). To prove this, he first distinguishes between analytic and synthetic propositions. An analytic proposition is one that is true by nature of the words in the sentence, and does not require outside knowledge or proof other than the definition of the words. For example, "All bachelors are unmarried." We know this is true without any proof by virtue of the fact that a bachelor is an umarried man by definition. A synthetic statement, on the other hand, states something that is not built-in to the definition of the word, and therefore tells us something about the world that requires proof. Their truth or falsehood comes from something outside of their linguistic content. Take the statement "All bodies have weight." It's not required, as per the dictionary definition, for a body to have weight. Experience of the body is required before its heaviness becomes clear. Its weight requires experience to be known.</p>
					<p>Up until Kant, it was assumed that all synthetic statements required experience to be known. Kant, however, rejected this assumption by claiming that arithmetic is synthetic <i lang="la">a priori</i>, in that mathematical statements provide new knowledge not derived from experience. Consider the equation 5 + 7 = 12. There is nothing in the definitions of 5 or 7 from which 12 can be inferred. So it is a synthetic statement and therefore, according to the assumptions of previous philosophers, require experience to be known. Yet one could still solve this sum without ever having done this particular sum before if they had a grasp of arithmetic. Therefore 5 + 7 = 12 is a synthetic <i lang="la">a priori</i> proposition, and thus Kant argued a proposition can be both synthetic and <i lang="la">a priori</i>.

					<h2>Death and Burial</h2>
					<p>Kant died in <span lang="de">K&ouml;nigsberg</span> on the 12th of February 1804. His last words were "<i lang="de">Es ist gut</i> (It is good)". His remaining unfinished works were published as <i lang="la">Opus Postumum</i>. Originally buried in the <span lang="de">K&ouml;nigsberg</span> Cathedral, his remains were later disinterred and moved to a neo-Gothic chapel. Decades later the chapel was demolished and Kant's own mausoleum was built on the same spot. When he was disinterred, it was noted that his skull was considerably larger than the average German male's. This had been a point of debate for some time, with some wondering were his portraits depicted as having a large forehead because he was a philosopher, or was he a philosopher because of the intelligence manifested by his large forehead? While it is now clear that his forehead was indeed large and not exaggerated by the painters, whether or not his large forehead had any correlation with his intelligence remains unknown.</p>
