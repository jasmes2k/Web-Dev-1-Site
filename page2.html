                    Jess and Jem are dogs. The dog(<i lang="la">Canis lupus familiaris</i> - <i lang="la">familiaris</i> means family! Isn't that nice?) was the very first species to be domesticated by man, and is regarded as an S-tier support class in the game. Regular dogs provide a passive morale boost to the team, but they can also spec into specialised classes - such as police dog or guide dog, the latter of which can entirely negate the blindness debuff. This has led to claims by some players, especially those who main the cat or mailman classes, that the dog is overpowered and in need of a nerf. It's true that the dog is dominant in the current meta, but I feel dogs are only OP in this meta because they are the primary support class for humans. It is the human who is overpowered, not the dog. The latter's overpowered nature is merely a symptom of the insanely broken human class. I've personally been calling for a balance patch for a long time, and I support the devs' move to nerf the humans with their brand-new "Climate Change" patch, designed to provide more challenge for human mains and limit the viability of their usual strategies(which many mains of other classes contend are game-breaking exploits, like fracking). The question, however, is: Is this really enough of a nerf? There has never been another class in the history of the game as overpowered as the human is now, and many professional players in the e-sports scene say that far more nerfs need to make the other classes viable in pro-play.
